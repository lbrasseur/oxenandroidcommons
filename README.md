#Oxen Android Commons

This project is an incubator for Android-related components developed at Oxen Software Studio.

As long as each component grows, the could be separated into a new, independent project.

At the moment, in progress components include:

 * [MVP with Field-to-bean binding](https://github.com/lbrasseur/oxenandroidcommons/wiki/Property)
 * [Oxen Java Commons Licensing](https://github.com/lbrasseur/oxenjavacommons/) support classes

Eclipse, Maven, Android SDK and Eclipse Android plugin are required.

Just download the trunk and run mvn eclipse:eclipse. Then select "import existing projects" from Eclipse.

You can find details for each release [here](https://github.com/lbrasseur/oxenandroidcommons/wiki/Releases).
